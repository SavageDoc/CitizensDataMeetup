```

## Executive Summary

- Discussion of implementation of Neural Network or Linear Model was had on `r Sys.time()`
- Facilitated by `r Sys.info()['user']`
- Decision reached to implement *neither* for reasons including:
```{r reasons, comment=''}
print( docRV$reasons )
```

## Next Steps

- Re-assess project scope, data sources, deliverables, timelines and budget
- Ensure documentation is prepared for project suspension
