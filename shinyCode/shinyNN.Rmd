## Executive Summary

- Discussion of implementation of Neural Network or Linear Model was had on `r Sys.time()`
- Facilitated by `r Sys.info()['user']`
- Decision reached to implement the Neural Network for reasons including:
```{r reasons, comment=''}
print( docRV$reasons  )
```

## Next Steps

- Code and technical documentation to be delivered to validation
- Support for governance committees to be arranged.
